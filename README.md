## Overview

Emerging technologies are reshaping industries by introducing novel solutions and improving existing processes. This repository is dedicated to advancing knowledge and application in three pivotal areas:

1. **Data Quality:** Ensuring the integrity, accuracy, and consistency of data.
2. **Homomorphic Encryption:** Enabling secure computation on encrypted data.
3. **Blockchain with Data Provenance:** Providing traceability and authenticity of data transactions.

## Subprojects

### Data Quality

The Data Quality subproject aims to address the challenges associated with maintaining high-quality data. It focuses on:

- **Data Profiling:** Analyzing data sources to understand their structure, content, and quality.
- **Data Cleaning:** Techniques and tools for correcting errors and inconsistencies in data.
- **Data Quality Metrics:** Establishing and measuring metrics to assess data quality.

### Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic Encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. This subproject covers:

- **Basic Concepts:** Introduction to homomorphic encryption and its mathematical foundations.
- **Implementation:** Sample implementations of homomorphic encryption algorithms.
- **Applications:** Use cases and applications of homomorphic encryption in various industries.

### Blockchain with Data Provenance

Blockchain technology combined with data provenance ensures the traceability and integrity of data. This subproject includes:

- **Blockchain Fundamentals:** Understanding the basics of blockchain technology.
- **Data Provenance:** Techniques for tracking the origin and changes to data.
- **Integration:** Implementing data provenance solutions using blockchain.
